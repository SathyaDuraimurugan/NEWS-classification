# 📰 News Classification using Machine Learning

This project implements a machine learning model to classify news articles into predefined categories such as Politics, Sports, Technology, Business, and more. It leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques and supervised learning algorithms to automate the classification of text data.

---

## 🔍 Features

- Preprocessing of raw text (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal)
- Vectorization using TF-IDF or CountVectorizer
- Classification using models like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or SVM
- Evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- Interactive interface or notebook for prediction
- Visualizations: Confusion Matrix, Word Clouds, etc.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Scikit-learn, NLTK, pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn  
- **Optional:** Streamlit / Flask for Web Interface  
- **Dataset:** Kaggle or custom news dataset (CSV)
